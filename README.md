Ludum Dare 40 :: Theme "The more you have, the worse it is"
====================

A game made in ~48 hours for the [40th Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40) game development jam using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). The theme was "The more you have, the worse it is". At some point I may update this template text with a proper description... until then enjoy the mystery.

License
-----------

This code does not currently have a license. Until one is picked out it's probably safest to assume **the source code here is for educational** (and auditing) **purposes**. While bug reports are welcome, it's best you don't assume the code will end up with a proper open source license.

Build and Run
-----------

You will need the [Unity 2017.2 (or compatible) Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-2017.2.0) to build this repository. A binary version should be provided somewhere else that can be run without installing the engine (check any webpages associated with this project). To open the project simply start Unity and point it to the root folder of this repository (you'll have to download or clone it). From there you can modify the game, or simply build a version for a platform binaries are currently not supplied for. Because this project does not currently have a license, you may not publicly re-release it, with or without your own changes.

Present Color Should Represent Something (Average Cost, Type Of Present)


Color Of Person COULD Represent an Attribute (that's a bit racist though, eh?)


Fiend Name Corrpous
  EXAMPLES:
    John P.
    Mark K.
    Karl M.


WHERE DO YOU ASSIGN THE PURCHASED PRESENTS TO INDIVIDUALS
  rather than purchasing a bunch and then assigning, you buy presents for your friends list in the
  order they appear, the upkeep screen will show what each friend got, and if they liked it (emoji?)
    CAN YOU SKIP A FRIEND????? (and not buy for them that round)


WHEN DOES THE GAME END????
  WHEN FAILING A ROUND GOAL (THREE STRIKES AND YOUR OUT)
    - ex: Keep ALL of your friends this round.
    - ex: Spend less than $X this round.
    - ex: Don't buy RED presents this round. (mixed presents ORANGE is RED and YELLOW)
    - ex: Don't buy cheap presents this round.
